# CodeStorm Challenge

The **CodeStorm Challenge** is an intense coding competition designed to test:
- Programming skills  
- Problem-solving abilities  
- Communication and explanation skills  

## Project Overview

- Total of **30 coding questions**
- Problems cover:
  - Algorithms
  - Data structures
  - Different programming paradigms
- I solve these questions using **Python (Google Colab)**.

## Video Explanation

As part of this project, I also created an explanatory video for the solutions of **any five selected questions**.  
The video explains:
- Thought process
- Approach to each problem
- How the code works step by step

(You can add a YouTube link here later if you upload the video.)

## Files

- `notebooks/codestorm_challenge_solutions.ipynb` – main notebook with solutions
- `.gitignore` – Python-related files to ignore

Note: The notebook is large, so GitHub cannot render it.
Please download the file to view it.
